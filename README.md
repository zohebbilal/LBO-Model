Simple LBO Model for EaseMyTrip (Educational Purpose Only)
I'm excited to share my recent Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model project built as part of my practice in financial modeling and valuation. For this project, I selected Easy Trip Planners Ltd. (EaseMyTrip), a leading online travel services provider, to explore the potential of applying advanced valuation techniques in the travel industry. This model includes:
âœ… Dashboard for overall view of the transaction
âœ… Transaction input & assumptions
âœ… Forecasted financials
âœ… Leveraged financing structure and debt schedule
âœ… Leveraged Free Cash Flow forecasting and debt repayment tracking

ðŸ’¡ Objective: This exercise aimed to deepen my understanding of transaction structuring, and valuation adjustments.

As a finance professional and passion for financial modeling, valuations, and M&A analysis, I am always eager to work on real-world deal scenarios. Always striving to enhance my expertise in this area, and I look forward to continuing to work on complex financial models and transactions in the future. If you have any feedback or suggestions on improving the model, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts!
